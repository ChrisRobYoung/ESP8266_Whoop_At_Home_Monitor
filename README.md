# Whoop at Home Monitor

This project collects Whoop data using the developer Whoop API and displays information on several simple peripheral devices. The project extends Whoop's "no frills" design by keeping information simple non-distracting. A single capacitance button and multicolor LED allow the user to visually determine their sleep, recovery, or strain data without having to open their phone.

* More to come.
